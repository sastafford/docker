# Docker Compose

[Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.  

Each folder represents a different Docker recipe for MarkLogic.  For each recipe, go to that directory and type in the following command. 

    docker-compose up -d
